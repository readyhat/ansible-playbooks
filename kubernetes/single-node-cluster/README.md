# Deploy A Single-Node Kubernetes Cluster

This playbook wil deploy a single-node Kubernetes "cluster" to a target machine and was developed to simplify deployment of development clusters quickly, frequently, and consistently.

*This playbook was developed based on the work of a collegue who documented the [manual steps](https://www.zews.org/kubernetes-1-18-on-fedora-32-with-kubeadm/) to deploy this same configuration.*

> IMPORTANT: This playbook **should not** be used to deploy production Kubernetes clusters.
